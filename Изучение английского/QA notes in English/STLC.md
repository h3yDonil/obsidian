**Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)** is the process that helps organize and structure testing of a software product to make sure it’s high quality and meets the requirements.

## Stages of the Software Testing Life Cycle:

### 1. Requirement Analysis

At this stage, we study and analyze the requirements to check if they’re complete, logical, and don’t contradict each other. This helps us figure out the scope and direction of testing.

### 2. Test Planning

We create a detailed test plan that includes deadlines, testing methods and tools, resource allocation, and quality criteria.

### 3. Test Case Development

We write test cases that describe how to check specific features (like user registration, order placement) or complex business processes (like ordering with delivery).

### 4. Test Environment Setup

We set up the test environment — servers, databases, necessary software, and access rights. DevOps specialists usually help here. The environment can be local, remote, or cloud-based.

### 5. Test Execution

We run the tests using the prepared test cases, record the results, and log any defects found.

### 6. Test Closure

After testing, we analyze the results and prepare reports. If all found defects are fixed, the functionality is handed over for release.
